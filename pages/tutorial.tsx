                1. Save script as Text File (.txt)
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                In a text editor (Google Docs, Microsoft Word), write out the
                script you'd like to use for your video narration. Insert image
                descriptions, in brackets, into the script where you would like
                them to appear. Be as specific as possible and double-check your
                spelling, as the Video Creator selects a top search result from
                Google Images. Save the script as a text file (.txt).
                <br />
                <br />
                In this example, the video will start with a picture of Romeo
                and Juliet art, then an image of William Shakespeare will appear
                after the narration says the phrase "written by‚Äù

              </Box>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                Make sure there is an image description at the very start of the
                script, or else the program won't know what image to start the
                video with.

              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                Click the Upload Script button to upload the text file from your
                computer to the Video Creator Tool.

                3. Record Your Voice-over or Use a Computer-Generated Voice
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                A computer-generated voice-over of your script will
                automatically be used. However, if you prefer to use your own
                voice-over, create a recording of yourself reading the script.
                You should read the text exactly as written, without the image
                descriptions-we suggest copying and pasting the script and
                deleting the image descriptions so you have a clean copy to read
                from. Save your voice-over as an audio file (.mp3).
                <br />
                <br />
                To easily record your own voiceover, use an online voice
                recorder such as{' '}
                <a
                  href="https://online-voice-recorder.com/"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >
                  online-voice-recorder.com
                </a>{' '}
                (to start recording, click the small red circle on the homepage;
                to re-record, refresh the page).
              </Typography>
            </Box>
          </Box>
        </Layout>
      </main>
